# 🛸 Fun Projects: 3D Hand-Controlled Antigravity

Welcome to my **Fun Projects** lab! This is a space where I build cool, interactive, and slightly futuristic experiments just for the joy of coding. 

First up in the lab: **The Antigravity Particle Swarm**. 

It’s exactly what it sounds like—a 3D particle universe that stays in the palm of your hand. Literally.

## ✨ What is this thing?

This is a real-time 3D particle system built with **Three.js** that uses **MediaPipe** (Google's hand-tracking AI) to turn your webcam into a motion controller. No fancy sensors or VR gloves needed—just your hands and a browser.

### 🕹️ How to Play:
*   **👋 Flow & Rotate:** Just move your hand around. The particle swarm follows you. Tilt your hand to spin the whole galaxy.
*   **👌 Pinch to Zoom:** Bring your thumb and index finger together to shrink the shape, or spread them wide to make it huge. 
*   **✊ The Implosion:** Close your hand into a fist to "grab" all the particles. They’ll rush toward your palm and vibrate with energy.
*   **🌈 Change the Vibe:** Use the UI to swap shapes (DNA, Galaxies, Hearts!) or pick a color that matches your mood.

## 🛠️ The Tech Behind the Magic

I built this using a "clean and simple" philosophy:
- **Language:** HTML5, Modern CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Engine:** [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the heavy 3D lifting.
- **Brain:** [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) for the AI-powered hand tracking.
- **Vibe:** Glassmorphism UI for that sleek, premium look.

## 🚀 Run it yourself

This is a **single-file app**. No `npm install`, no complex builds. Just pure code.

1.  Download `index.html`.
2.  Open it in any modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended).
3.  Allow camera access and start controlling the swarm!
